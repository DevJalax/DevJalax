About Me

I’m a passionate backend developer with expertise in Java, Spring Boot, and distributed systems, always exploring ways to build scalable and efficient architectures. My experience spans Kafka, RabbitMQ, Redis, KeyDB, MySQL, and hybrid cloud models across AWS, Azure, and GCP. I specialize in designing high-performance APIs, optimizing two-way SSL, and managing interdependent microservices.

Currently, I’m expanding my tech stack by diving into Python, C#, and Ruby while also exploring Dart and Flutter with Bloc for state management. I thrive on tackling complex backend challenges, from reconciliation processes to self-evolving API gateways with AI-driven optimizations.

Beyond tech, I have a keen interest in history, apocalyptic scenarios, and travel—always looking for new places to explore!
